<p id="">If you’ve been following along, you know my passion lies in Web3 marketing—understanding the strategies, the communities, and the narratives that make this space so unique. But for the past few months, I’ve been pulled deeper down the rabbit hole. I realized that to truly understand how to market the future, I needed to get my hands dirty and actually <em id="">build</em> it.</p><p id="">I haven't been gone; I've been in the lab.</p><p id="">My focus has expanded from just the "what" and "why" of Web3 to the "how." This journey has led me down two incredibly exciting paths: hands-on <strong id="">Web3 development</strong> and building practical <strong id="">AI Agents &amp; Automated Workflows</strong>.</p><h3 id="">From Marketing Strategy to Building the Engine</h3><p id="">It started with a simple thought: "How does this <em id="">actually</em> work?" That question led me to build my own <strong id="">smart contract monitoring dashboard</strong> from scratch. This wasn't just a simple project; it was a full-stack application designed to provide real-time analytics for on-chain activity.</p><p id="">The system listens to live <code id="">Transfer</code> events from a major token contract like USDC. I built a resilient <strong id="">Python</strong> listener with <strong id="">Web3.py</strong> that ingests these events, saves them to a structured <strong id="">SQLite</strong> database, and serves the data via a <strong id="">Flask</strong> API. The frontend is a sleek, dynamic interface built with <strong id="">HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript</strong>, featuring live-updating stats, a filterable table of transactions, interactive charts, and even an AI-powered panel that translates natural language questions into custom database queries.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668bc58fd794990dd4fcf8fd/68669a21b1d8971ed185a720_AD_4nXe4p7MIliiZXJaLsT3JjYj0x8YhJ8_E-MC5z5twobb5MErJrM9FoR1e3rxfmWgkdwRx2HRbnyp0wEf22Y7ayv-u3-1Z_Er0W9mNy46RcVhRPHXzpSev18qbJrJSSB9AwFjA9MXB6Q.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" loading="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">smart contract monitor dashboard</figcaption></figure><p id="">This project forced me to move beyond marketing theory and into the practical realities of data engineering and full-stack development. It wasn't a distraction; it was an upgrade.</p><h2 id="">My lab: Building with AI agents and automation</h2><p id="">At the same time, I became obsessed with efficiency and intelligence. How can we make systems smarter and more automated? This led me to the world of AI Agents and automation platforms like n8n. Instead of just talking about concepts, I started building practical tools.</p><p id="">Here are a few of the workflows I've been developing:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://github.com/Toms-x/automation-projects/tree/main/script-generator" target="_blank"><strong id="">YouTube content writer</strong></a><strong id="">:</strong> This workflow fetches trending finance topics from Reddit, Google Trends, and finance news sources every 24 hours. It filters and combines the results, then uses AI to pick the best topics and generate YouTube video scripts automatically.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668bc58fd794990dd4fcf8fd/686572df7f86a076a0f7e5ed_AD_4nXfw8Jh_IRGcRlBjB3xnfTXdNuTnwYmGJD9G5gBWzkKMSXteinkp2aYns5nFO4kjj31eotCNHhesiDq-z4rDxakM2IuJ0RpCV4WvlhLNloGZfj_5UINNyPAZqzWQp_AvpAbFhhcurA.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="YouTube content writer workflow " loading="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">youtube content writer workflow </figcaption></figure><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://github.com/Toms-x/automation-projects/tree/main/reddit-ad" target="_blank"><strong id="">Reddit Ad Generator</strong></a><strong id="">:</strong> This workflow automates the creation of marketing content by using a product description to find relevant customer pain points on Reddit. It then uses AI to turn those pain points into ranked advertising angles and generates 4-panel comic strip images for each, which are then saved to Google Drive.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668bc58fd794990dd4fcf8fd/6865a871a509b4b6b4aee146_AD_4nXdnFfa4Qw8IEmY11kt5Pm7eOG4DXMc_FppJCfU5cOjJzOO-vmBpk4gVI_yow4PgXNaD2YVCCPrNiCQnbVkvZjhSFyBR7CUI8lZnE_Iy9J7PHcEJcYoHAWCvFz2Vl2rbOS3pcplvEA.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Reddit Ad Generator workflow" loading="auto" id=""></div><figcaption id="">reddit<strong id=""> </strong>ad<strong id=""> </strong>generator workflow</figcaption></figure><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://github.com/Toms-x/automation-projects/tree/main/personal-ai-assistant"><strong id="">Personal AI Assistant</strong></a><strong id="">:</strong> This workflow creates an AI-powered personal assistant that operates within Telegram and can understand and respond to user messages.

I'll be sharing the complete journey of the projects I'm building, including:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Project Breakdowns:</strong> Deep dives into the architecture of tools like the monitoring dashboard and the AI workflows.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Technical Tutorials:</strong> How to set up your own listeners, build APIs, and connect them to a frontend.</li><li id=""><strong id="">AI and Automation in Web3:</strong> Practical guides on using tools like n8n and AI to create powerful, automated systems for your own projects or marketing efforts.</li></ul><p id="">My focus is on bridging the gap between strategy and execution, and it's time to put theory into practice.</p><p id="">I appreciate your patience—the lab is now open! I've included GitHub links for each workflow, so you can directly import them and get started right away.</p><p id="">For a closer look at what I'm building and to discover how AI automation can be applied to marketing systems, I invite you to subscribe to my weekly newsletter.
