<p id="">I was scrolling through X the other day and stumbled upon a fascinating post about a new way for companies to find leads on Reddit. It described an automated workflow where a business simply provides a <strong id="">product description</strong>, and the system intelligently scours Reddit to find users discussing relevant <strong id="">pain points</strong> and frustrations. By pinpointing these conversations, the tool allows companies to bypass cold outreach and instead engage directly with potential customers who are already describing the exact problems their product solves, essentially serving up a list of highly qualified leads ready to be converted.</p><p id="">To be fair, this sounds like a practical solution to a genuine problem. It's no secret that lead generation is a major headache for marketers, in fact, over <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-tools" id="">61% say</a> it's their biggest challenge. Think about the countless hours wasted on manual research that yields little to no results. Meanwhile, your ideal customers are already gathered on Reddit, a massive community of over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1453133/reddit-quarterly-dau-by-online-status/" id="">108 million daily active users</a>, talking about the very problems you can solve.</p><p id="">That's why I built this AI workflow to change everything.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">How the complete workflow works</strong></h2><p id="">This <a href="https://github.com/Toms-x/automation-projects/tree/main/reddit-ad">workflow</a> is a multi-step pipeline that uses AI to automate market research, copywriting, and creative direction.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668bc58fd794990dd4fcf8fd/686c202dced6dc325b4ccc94_AD_4nXecrPmRs7qpVocpzNcYl82cSoifyU4ip3dCYO-daEYl-sYNXmfEV6XP6EDfiQIopgre5o1olA2CTfIHktrEj5WRjaYC7WiCvyjZuDQRI0Ajq3lFXOGs7kOZXo-0a8zDVC1Ry1uJ.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" loading="auto" id=""></div><figcaption>reddit-powered ad generator</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><ol id=""><li><strong id="">Input and keyword extraction</strong>: The process starts when you submit a simple form with your brand name, website, and product description. An AI model analyzes the description to extract a core <strong id="">"pain point" keyword</strong> (1-3 words) that a potential customer might use on Reddit.</li><li><strong id="">Reddit research and filtering</strong>: The workflow uses this keyword to <strong id="">search all of Reddit</strong> for relevant posts. It then filters these results, keeping only discussions that have meaningful engagement (more than 2 upvotes) and actual text content.</li><li><strong id="">AI relevance classification</strong>: Each filtered post is passed to a second AI agent. This agent reads the post in the context of your product and determines if it's a genuinely relevant conversation where a customer is expressing a need your product can solve.</li><li><strong id="">Ad angle generation</strong>: All the verified, relevant Reddit posts are aggregated into a single list. A "copywriter" AI then reads this list of real-world frustrations and generates <strong id="">10 unique, punchy marketing messages</strong> or ad angles that frame your product as the solution.</li><li><strong id="">Creative direction</strong>: The best ad angles are then sent to a "creative director" AI. This agent's job is to write detailed prompts for an image generator, describing a <strong id="">4-panel comic strip</strong> that visually tells the story of the customer's pain point and the product's solution.</li><li><strong id="">Image generation and storage</strong>: Finally, the workflow loops through each comic strip prompt, sending it to <strong id="">DALL-E 3 to generate the image</strong>. The final 4-panel comic ad is then automatically saved to a designated folder in your Google Drive.</li></ol><h2 id=""><strong id="">My real-world test - ‘bitcoin’ results</strong></h2><p id="">I tested my workflow with Web3/Bitcoin keywords focusing on "crypto confusion" and "Bitcoin basics."
